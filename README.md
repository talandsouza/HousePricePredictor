# House Price Predictor

This is a simple linear regression example that demonstrates how to create a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on the number of bedrooms in a house. The example includes code for generating example data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model, making predictions, and visualizing the results.



## How to Run

1. Install Required Libraries:
  Make sure you have the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`) installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using the following command:
  `pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`

3. Copy the Code:
Copy the provided code from the corresponding Python file or clone the repository.

4. Save the File:
  Save the code in a Python script file, for example, `houseprice.py`.

5. Run the Program:
  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script, and run the script using the Python interpreter.

The program will execute and display the results, including a plot showing the actual vs. predicted house prices.
